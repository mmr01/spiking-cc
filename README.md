# Non-uniform spiking touch sensor for classification of movement patterns using neural networks 

In this work, we show that machine intelligence is capable of performing the classification of a continuous movement pattern over a touch sensor surface. We propose a new capacitive touch sensor design with a dielectric with non-uniform electrical permittivity. A sensor of that kind, connected to a signal conditioning circuit, generates a spiking signal that encodes spatial information. The sensor behaves similarly to a slowly-adapting type I (SA-I) first-order tactile neuron that provides tactile information to a human neural system. The significance of our research is that, unlike other approaches, we do not use a sensor array, just a single sensor that encodes the movement patterns into a time series. We demonstrate how to select the artificial neural network (ANN) architecture, prepare a training dataset and train the network to achieve over 97 % accuracy in recognising the movement patterns related to the writing of Arabic numerals. The development of the touch sensor working with an ANN described in this work might find potential applications with future human machine interaction (HMI) interfaces.
